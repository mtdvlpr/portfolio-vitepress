# Browser Technology

Browser Technology was the third course of the minor Web Design & Development at the HvA. The course is about creating a web app that works for everyone, no matter what browser or device they use.

## Assignment

For this course, I had to create a digital version of a tax form using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had to make sure that the form is accessible to everyone and that it works on all devices, browsers and screen sizes. It should also work if CSS or JavaScript or both are disabled.
