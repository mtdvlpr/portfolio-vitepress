# CSS to the Rescue

CSS to the Rescue was the second course of the minor Web Development at the HvA. The course is about experimenting with CSS to create a cool, interactive website without using JavaScript.

## Assignments

There were two assignments during this course. An individual one and a team one.

### Individual assignment

For this course, I had to create a cool, interactive website using only CSS. I had to experiment with new(ish) CSS features. I chose to create a Pacman game using only CSS.

### Team assignment

For the team assignment, I had to work together with a team to experiment with new(ish) CSS features related to colors and present the results to our classmates.
