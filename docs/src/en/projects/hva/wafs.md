# Web App From Scratch

Web App From Scratch was the first course of the minor Web Design & Development at the HvA. The course is about creating a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Assignments

There were two assignments during this course. An individual one and a team one.

### Individual assignment

For this course, I had to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had to create a web app that uses an API to get data and display it on the page. I also had to create a feature that allows the user to interact with the data. I had to make sure that the web app is accessible to everyone. I also had to make sure that the web app works on all devices and screen sizes.

### Team assignment

For the team assignment, I had to work together with a team to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We had to create a web app that fetches data from the individual assignments and displays it on the page.
