# Web App From Scratch

Web App From Scratch was the first course of the minor Web Design & Development at the HvA. The course was about creating a web app from scratch using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Assignments

There were two assignments during this course. An individual one and a team one.

### Individual assignment

For this course, Manoah had to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He had to create a web app that uses an API to get data and display it on the page and had to create a feature that allows the user to interact with the data. He had to make sure that the web app is accessible to everyone and that the web app works on all devices and screen sizes.

### Team assignment

For the team assignment, Manoah had to work together with a team to create a web app from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They had to create a web app that fetches data from the individual assignments and displays it on the page.
